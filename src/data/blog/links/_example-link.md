description: "This is an example link showing how to add custom introductions."

This is an example of the new unified content system. You can now add your own introduction, commentary, or context to links you share.

This makes it much easier to share interesting articles with a bit of context about why they're worth reading, without having to write a full blog post.

The link will appear in the main posts listing alongside regular articles, but with a special icon to indicate it's an external link.
