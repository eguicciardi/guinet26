I am a senior developer with extensive experience in designing, building, and delivering digital solutions. Over the years, I’ve worked across multiple layers of the development process: from backend and full-stack engineering to DevOps, prototyping, and project management. My background includes gathering requirements, translating ideas into scalable architectures, and guiding projects from concept to release.

I started my career with PHP back in version 4 and became highly experienced in CMS ecosystems such as Drupal and WordPress. In recent years, I’ve shifted my focus towards the modern JavaScript ecosystem, working extensively with the MERN stack, Node.js, and frameworks like Next.js and Astro. On the backend side, I build APIs and services with Node and Express, always with a strong emphasis on reliability, performance and security.

Beyond development, I work with Docker and AWS (EC2, ECR, ALB, and more) to ensure smooth deployments and scalable infrastructure. For prototyping and product design, I use tools like Adobe XD and Figma to bridge the gap between design and implementation.

My passion lies in building practical, user-focused solutions while exploring new technologies that push projects forward.
